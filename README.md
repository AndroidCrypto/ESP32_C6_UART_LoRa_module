# ESP32 C6 Super Mini connected to an UART interfaced LoRa module

Connecting an UART interfaced LoRa module to an ESP32-C6 Super Mini development board is super easy. With this combination you are being able to receive and transmit LoRa packets and maybe use the ESP32-C6 as gateway to a Zigbee system ?
