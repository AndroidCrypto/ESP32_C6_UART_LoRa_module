Log file for a settings session

Important: in the Send Options, select "Append Frame Tail" and use:
Append checksum: NONE
Append frame tail CR+LF (gives 0D 0A)
click on OK

In Recv Options use:
Encoder: ASCII
Autolinefeed enabled

In Serial Options, use:
Baudrate: 9600
Databits: 8
Stopbits: 1
Paritybits: NONE
Flowctrl: NONE

click on "OPEN"

In "Data Send" enter 
+++
and click on "Send"

The resonse is in Data Receive window:
Entry AT

Now the module is in Command Mode

Enter: AT+HELP
Response:
===================================
LoRa Parameter:
+VERSION=V2.3.1
MODE:0
LEVEL:0 >> 244.140625bps
SLEEP:2
Frequency:868000000hz >> 24
MAC:ff,ff
Bandwidth:0
Spreading Factor:12
Coding rate:2
CRC:0(false)
Preamble:8
IQ:0(false)
Power:22dBm
===================================

These are the default parameters the module is working with.As I'm located in Germany/Europe,
the frequency of 868 MHz is fine, but you should check this with your local, allowed LoRa frequency band.

To exit the Command mode, enter
+++
Response:
Exit AT
Power on

Run:
+++

Change parameters, this is my testing setup:
a) change frequency to 863.500 MHz
See pages 22 + 23 of DX-LR02-900T22D Serial port application guide
There is a table with the predefined channels, for 863.5 select "1B"
AT+CHANNEL1B
+CHANNEL=1b
OK

b) Change bandwidth to 125 KHz (that is the default) and Spreadingfactor to 7, this can be done with one call to LEVEL, see page 21:
AT+LEVEL5
OK

c) Change coding rate to "4/5"
See page 25
AT+CR1
OK

d) Change transmit power to 0 dBm (the lowest rate for my testings)
See page 24
AT+POWE0
OK

Nun check out changes:
AT+HELP

=========================================
If you are receiving something like:
?   ?C   ?­A ?BIJwD
your module received a pure data (hex) encoded packet. In Recv Options
change ASCII to HEX and you will see, e.g., this for the next packet:
04 9C 43 00 00 00 A4 70 AD 41 00 26 11 42 97 50 77 44 68 9E 79 40 44 00 FE 

Note: the device is operating per default in MODE 0 meaning Transparent Mode.
Everyone on this frequiency is being able to see this packet !
